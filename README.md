# LookAtTheMouse
This application displays a pair of eyes that follow the pointer in the browser.
# Future Improvements
I plan on adding a pair of glasses and a mouth that opens when the mouse button is clicked. I would need to make changes to the html and styles sheet in order to accomplish this. to get the mouse to open, I would need to alter the JS file as well. I dont own any of these files. they belong to MIT.
